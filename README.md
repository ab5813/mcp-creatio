## What it does

- **CRUD + schema** — read, create, update, delete records; list entity sets; inspect schemas.
- **Business processes** — run Creatio workflows with parameters.
- **System settings** — read, write, and manage system-setting metadata.
- **Feature toggles** — manage `Feature` / `AdminUnitFeatureState` and refresh the feature cache.
  ⚠️ Only DB-backed features are reachable (those defined solely in `web.config` are invisible).
- **System operations** — manage `SysAdminOperation` and per-user/role grants (OData blocks these
  tables, so dedicated tools are provided).
- **Custom services** — invoke any configuration-package REST service (`/0/rest/<service>/<method>`)
  when no dedicated tool fits.
- **Selectable data backend** — Creatio DataService (default) or OData v4 (`CREATIO_MCP_CRUD_BACKEND`).
- **Optional semantic layers** — DataForge and Global Search tools auto-register when the instance
  supports them.

Works with Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Connectors, GitHub Copilot, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Quick start

The server runs in one of two transports. **Pick by how your client connects**, then pick an
[authentication](#authentication) method.

### stdio (single-user, local)

For clients that launch a command directly (VS Code MCP, Claude Desktop). Single Creatio identity
per process; authenticate with **client credentials** or **legacy** login.

```bash
npx -y mcp-creatio@latest \
  --base-url https://your-creatio.com \
  --login your_login --password your_password
```

```jsonc
// VS Code / Claude Desktop (command-based)
{
	"creatio": {
		"command": "npx",
		"args": [
			"-y",
			"mcp-creatio@latest",
			"--base-url",
			"https://your-creatio.com",
			"--login",
			"your_login",
			"--password",
			"your_password",
		],
	},
}
```

> stdio logs are silent by default — enable with `--log-level info` or `CREATIO_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`.

### HTTP (multi-user, hosted)

For clients that connect by URL, and for multi-user / hosted deployments. This transport serves the
`broker`, `delegated`, and `gateway` auth modes (see [Authentication](#authentication)).

```bash
npm start                     # serves http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

```jsonc
{ "creatio": { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp" } }
```

---

## Authentication

One unified selector — `CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE` — picks how a request proves its Creatio identity.
When unset it is inferred from the credentials you provide. The HTTP modes are multi-user; stdio is
single-user.

| Mode                     | Transport    | How identity is established                                                                     | When to use                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`broker`**             | HTTP         | The MCP is its own OAuth server: it walks the user through Creatio login and holds their tokens | **Standalone direct clients** (Claude Desktop / ChatGPT) — connect → authorize → work as you |
| **`delegated`**          | HTTP         | The client brings a Creatio token; the MCP validates expiry and passes it through               | Clients that obtain a Creatio token themselves / behind an external AS                       |
| **`gateway`**            | HTTP         | A trusted Control-Plane injects the token per request                                           | Behind the Creatio.ai Control-Plane (multi-tenant)                                           |
| **`client_credentials`** | stdio / HTTP | One service account (`client_id` / `secret`)                                                    | M2M / single service identity                                                                |
| **`legacy`**             | stdio / HTTP | One user (login / password)                                                                     | Local / legacy instances                                                                     |

> The MCP issues Creatio tokens of its own only in `broker` mode (where it must, to drive the
> login). `delegated`/`gateway` pass tokens through; `client_credentials`/`legacy` use a single
> server-side identity.

> external client** that needs the MCP itself to verify identity, use `broker` — there the MCP
> issues and verifies its own audience-bound (`aud`/`iss`) tokens.

### `broker` — the "connect & authorize" UX for direct clients

The MCP acts as an OAuth 2.1 authorization server for its clients (dynamic registration, authorize,
token) and brokers the actual login to Creatio via authorization_code with PKCE. The client only
ever talks to the MCP, so this works even though Creatio offers no dynamic client registration — and
the client never needs to reach Creatio's TLS endpoint directly.

The tokens the MCP issues to clients are **audience-bound** (`aud` = this deployment's `/mcp`
resource, `iss` = its origin), so a token minted by one deployment is rejected by another even when
they share a secret. The MCP also supports the **`refresh_token` grant** (rotating), so a client
gets a fresh access token without re-running the browser flow every hour — for as long as the MCP
still holds that user's Creatio tokens.

```bash
CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE=broker
CREATIO_CLIENT_ID=your_creatio_oauth_app_client_id   # the Creatio "On behalf of a user" app
CREATIO_MCP_JWT_SECRET=a-long-random-secret-min-32   # signs the tokens the MCP issues to clients
# CREATIO_CLIENT_SECRET=...                            # only for a confidential Creatio app (omit for public/PKCE)
```

> **`CREATIO_MCP_JWT_SECRET`** must be **at least 32 characters** (HS256 security rests entirely on
> its entropy — a shorter value is rejected at startup). In **production** (`NODE_ENV=production`) it
> is **required** (the server fails closed if unset). Outside production an unset secret yields a
> random one so a local run needs no setup — but the tokens the MCP issues are then invalidated on
> every restart and are not valid across multiple instances, so **set a stable secret for production
> or any horizontally-scaled deployment.**

**Persistence / horizontal scaling (broker holds users' Creatio tokens).** By default those tokens
live in-process — fine for a single instance, but lost on restart and not shared across replicas.
For production set a **Redis** token store: tokens are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) and survive
restarts, so the broker becomes stateless and horizontally scalable.

```bash
CREATIO_MCP_TOKEN_STORE=redis
CREATIO_MCP_REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis:6379
# CREATIO_MCP_TOKEN_ENC_KEY=...   # optional; encryption key, else derived from CREATIO_MCP_JWT_SECRET
```

**Logout / revocation.** The broker exposes an **RFC 7009** `POST /revoke` endpoint (advertised as
`revocation_endpoint` in the AS metadata): presenting an issued token revokes the user's Creatio
token upstream (`/connect/revocation`, best-effort) and purges the server-side Creatio tokens and
issued refresh tokens. It always answers `200` (no token-validity oracle).

Register the Creatio app in System Designer → _OAuth 2.0 applications_ → _On behalf of a user_, and
add the MCP callback (`http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback` for a local run) to its redirect URIs.

> **Web clients (Open WebUI, LibreChat, …).** Dynamic client registration accepts loopback and
> app-scheme redirect URIs out of the box (native apps). A web client redirects to its own https
> origin, which is rejected unless you allowlist it:
> `CREATIO_MCP_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_ORIGINS=https://open-webui.example.com` (comma-separated; https
> only, compared by origin).

### `delegated` (default when nothing else is set)

Pure resource server: each `/mcp` request must carry a Creatio access token; the MCP advertises the
authorization server (Creatio Identity) via **RFC 9728** and challenges unauthenticated requests, so
the client logs in directly against Creatio. Needs no server-side credentials. The token is passed
through unverified (Creatio is the authority) — a **trusted-environment** mode (see the trust note
above).

**What the client sends.** The MCP **client** attaches the Creatio access token as a Bearer header
on every `/mcp` request. In a client that supports static headers:

```jsonc
{
	"creatio": {
		"type": "http",
		"url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
		"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <CREATIO_ACCESS_TOKEN>" },
	},
}
```

Server side, just select the mode (no credentials needed):

```bash
CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE=delegated
CREATIO_BASE_URL=https://your-creatio.com
```

A request with **no** `Authorization` header gets `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge pointing
at Creatio Identity (RFC 9728), so a compliant client knows where to log in.

> **Forwarding a Creatio session cookie instead of a Bearer.** A client that authenticated to Creatio
> the classic way holds a **Forms-auth session** (cookie + `BPMCSRF`), not an OAuth token. It can
> forward that session instead of a Bearer by sending the cookie in **`X-Creatio-Cookie`** (and,
> optionally, the anti-forgery token in `X-Creatio-Bpmcsrf` — otherwise it is read from the cookie).
> The MCP attaches `Cookie` + `BPMCSRF` + `ForceUseSession` statelessly and lets Creatio validate it.
> `Authorization: Bearer` takes precedence when both are present.

### `gateway`

A trusted fronting service (Creatio.ai Control-Plane) injects the credential; the MCP trusts and uses
it. The optional `X-Creatio-Base-Url` header routes a request to a specific Creatio instance
(multi-tenant) — honored only in this mode. Because that override decides where the request's
credential is sent, it is validated: set **`CREATIO_MCP_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS`** (comma-separated origins)
to restrict it to your tenants. When unset, any `http(s)` host is accepted (trusting the gateway)
except the cloud-metadata link-local address, which is always blocked (SSRF guard).

**Who sends what.** Unlike `delegated`, the end client talks to the **gateway**, not to the MCP — so
the **gateway** is what injects the per-request headers. On each forwarded `/mcp` call it sends a
Creatio credential — either a Bearer token, or a forwarded Forms-auth session:

```http
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <CREATIO_ACCESS_TOKEN>     # a Bearer token …
X-Creatio-Cookie: BPMCSRF=<csrf>; .ASPXAUTH=<s>   # … OR forward a Forms-auth session instead
X-Creatio-Base-Url: https://tenant-a.creatio.com  # optional — pick the tenant's instance (multi-tenant)
```

Server side:

```bash
CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE=gateway
CREATIO_BASE_URL=https://default-creatio.com                          # fallback when no X-Creatio-Base-Url
CREATIO_MCP_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS=https://tenant-a.creatio.com,https://tenant-b.creatio.com  # SSRF allowlist
```

Smoke-test it directly with `curl` (mint a token out-of-band first):

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CREATIO_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Creatio-Base-Url: https://tenant-a.creatio.com" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get-current-user-info","arguments":{}}}'
```

> **Bearer or session cookie — nothing else.** The gateway injects either a Creatio OAuth **Bearer**
> token or a forwarded **Forms-auth session** (`X-Creatio-Cookie` + `BPMCSRF`); the MCP forwards it
> statelessly (no cookie jar, no per-credential pool) and Creatio validates it. The gateway owns auth —
> it should hold a ready Creatio credential of one of those two shapes. Other shapes (Basic, API key)
> are intentionally out of scope.

> **Per-tenant tool isolation.** A single MCP deployment serving many instances keeps each tenant's
> tool surface separate, keyed by the effective base URL (`X-Creatio-Base-Url`, else `CREATIO_BASE_URL`).
> Optional capabilities are **probed per tenant** and the tools they expose (DataForge, Global Search,
> and any dynamically discovered per-instance tools) are registered only for the tenant they were
> discovered on. Tenant A's tools or DataForge verdict never leak into tenant B's session, even though
> both share one process. The
> per-tenant state is pooled with idle-TTL + LRU eviction, so memory stays bounded as the number of
> distinct instances grows. Single-tenant modes (everything except `gateway` with an override) all map
> to one bucket, so their behavior is unchanged.

### `client_credentials` / `legacy`

```bash
CREATIO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id          # client_credentials
CREATIO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

CREATIO_LOGIN=YourLogin                   # legacy
CREATIO_PASSWORD=YourPassword
```

> **Precedence:** an explicit `CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE` always wins. When unset, the mode is inferred:
> legacy (login+password) → client_credentials (id+secret) → delegated. `broker`, `delegated` and
> `gateway` require HTTP transport (stdio has no incoming web request to authenticate).

## Configuration

Grouped from essential to optional. **`CREATIO_BASE_URL` is the only always-required value** —
nothing works without it; the rest depend on the auth method and the features you enable.

| `CREATIO_MCP_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS` | _Optional_ — proactive session keep-alive interval (seconds) for `legacy` / `client_credentials`, to avoid first-call re-login latency after an idle period. **Defaults to `300` (5 min)**; set `0` to disable. Keep it below the Creatio idle-session timeout                                     |
| `CREATIO_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`        | _Optional_ — the deployment's public origin (e.g. `https://mcp.example.com`). Set it when behind a TLS-terminating proxy/ingress so the broker's issuer/audience, redirect URIs, and discovery metadata use the external URL (not the internal `http://host:port`). Defaults to the request origin |

> **Disabling optional capabilities.** DataForge and Global Search are auto-detected at startup and
> registered only when supported. Set `CREATIO_MCP_DISABLE_DATAFORGE=true` /
> `CREATIO_MCP_DISABLE_GLOBAL_SEARCH=true` to skip the probe and the tools — useful to keep the tool
> surface small even when the capability exists.

## CRUD backend

CRUD tools (`read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `list-entities`, `describe-entity`) run on a
selectable data API, chosen once per deployment via `CREATIO_MCP_CRUD_BACKEND`:

- **`dataservice`** (default) — Creatio's native DataService.
- **`odata`** — Creatio OData v4. Also enables the OData-only `read` extras (raw `$filter`, `expand`).

Either way you query through the same tool surface: prefer the structured `filters` parameter — it
works unchanged on both backends.

| `call-configuration-service`     | Escape hatch: invoke any configuration-package REST service method by name. Use only when no dedicated tool covers the operation                         |

### Querying data with `read`

Ask for exactly the data you need — the AI doesn't have to know OData:

- **Filter any way** — equals / not-equals, ranges, text match (`contains`, `starts/ends with`),
  `AND` / `OR` groups, and "in this list".
- **Filter by related records naturally** — by name (`Contact/Name = "Andrew Baker"`) or by id.
- **Sort**, **paginate** (page size + offset), and **count** matches in one call.
- **Pull in related data** in a single request (e.g. an order with its account and contact).

### Reading file attachments with `read-file`

Attachments live in `<Section>File` entities (`ActivityFile`, `AccountFile`, `ContactFile`, custom
ones). `read` returns their **metadata** (name, size); `read-file` returns the **content**:

1. `read` on the file entity, selecting `["Id","Name","Size"]`, to locate the attachment.
2. `read-file` with that entity + `Id` → by default (`format:"text"`) the server extracts and
   returns readable text: `{ fileName, contentType, sizeBytes, text, extraction }`.
3. `format:"base64"` returns the raw bytes instead, for callers that need the original file.

**Text extraction covers:** `.docx` (paragraphs, tables, footnotes), `.xlsx` (CSV per sheet),
`.pdf` (text layer; image-only scans are **OCRed automatically** — Latvian/English/Russian by
default), `.edoc`/`.asice` signed containers (payload unwrapped, nested containers followed),
`.rtf` (incl. the cp1257 Baltic codepage), legacy `.doc`, Outlook `.msg`, and plain text. Images
have no text path and report `creatio_file_text_unsupported`. Extracted text is capped at
`maxChars` (default 150,000) with an `extraction.truncated` flag. Why text is the default: base64
of a typical `.docx` tokenizes ~17x larger than its text, and a chat-only MCP client cannot decode
binary at all.

**OCR knobs** (scanned PDFs): `CREATIO_MCP_OCR_LANGS` (default `lav+eng+rus`),
`CREATIO_MCP_OCR_LANG_PATH` (local traineddata dir for offline deployments — the Docker image
bundles it), `CREATIO_MCP_OCR_DISABLE=true` to turn OCR off. OCR needs the optional dependencies
(`tesseract.js`, `@napi-rs/canvas`); without them scanned PDFs report `ocr_unavailable`. OCR reads
the first 10 pages (`extraction.ocrPagesLimited` marks when it stopped early).

Downloads above `maxBytes` (default 10 MB = 10,000,000 bytes; hard cap 50 MB = 50,000,000, enforced
in the provider too) are refused with `creatio_file_too_large` — up front via `Content-Length` when
Creatio declares one, otherwise the streaming read stops the moment the limit is crossed, so an
oversized attachment never floods the transport or the server's memory. The tool is read-only
(available under `CREATIO_MCP_READONLY=true`) and uses the OData file API
(`GET /0/odata/<Entity>(<id>)/Data`), so it works under either CRUD backend.

### DataForge tools (registered only when DataForge is enabled)

DataForge is Creatio's AI-oriented semantic layer over the data model. These tools are **probed once**
and registered **only when the environment has DataForge configured** (a non-empty
`DataForgeServiceUrl` system setting). When DataForge is absent the tools are not exposed, and
`describe-entity` silently uses OData metadata.

| Tool                            | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataforge-similar-tables`      | Semantic search: map a natural-language query to the Creatio tables that best match its meaning   |
| `dataforge-table-details`       | Like `dataforge-similar-tables` but returns richer per-table details for the best matches         |
| `dataforge-table-relationships` | Find the relationship path(s) between two tables (how they join) — useful before `read`/`$expand` |
| `dataforge-lookup-values`       | Fuzzy/semantic search for lookup values (resolve a phrase to the right lookup record Id)          |
| `dataforge-status`              | Report whether DataForge is online and whether the data model / lookups are synced                |

**Discovery → confirm → act:** use `dataforge-similar-tables` to find the right entity, then
`describe-entity` for the authoritative field list, then `read`/`create`.

**Enabling DataForge** (Creatio side): the `DataForgeServiceUrl` system setting plus IdentityServer
settings (`IdentityServerUrl`, `IdentityServerClientId`/`Secret`), the `DataForge*` feature toggles,
and the `CanReadDataStructureColumnDetails` operation granted to the MCP user. Restart the app pool
(or run `DataStructureTransferFromCreatio` / `LookupsTransferFromCreatio`) to sync the model.

### Global Search tool (registered only when Global Search is enabled)

Global Search is Creatio's cross-entity, Elasticsearch-backed record search — the engine behind the
UI search box. Probed once, registered only when `GlobalSearchUrl` is configured.

| Tool            | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `global-search` | Full-text search across all indexed entities. Input: `query`, optional `entities[]`/`limit`/`from`. Returns matched records with `entityName`, `id`, `columnValues`, `total`/`nextFrom` |

Differs from `read`: `read` needs an exact entity + filter; `global-search` is fuzzy and
cross-entity — use it to locate a record when you don't know the entity.

**Enabling Global Search** requires the `GlobalSearchUrl` (+ `GlobalSearchConfigServiceUrl`,
`GlobalSearchIndexingApiUrl`) system settings and the `GlobalSearch` / `GlobalSearch_V2` feature
toggles, with the section index built (Elasticsearch reachable).

## Docker

The image supports both transports, selected by `CREATIO_MCP_TRANSPORT` (default `http`).

**HTTP** (remote / hosted / multi-client — defaults to delegated Bearer auth):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CREATIO_BASE_URL="https://your-creatio.com" \
  -e CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE=delegated \
  crackish/mcp-creatio
```

**stdio** (local client that spawns the process — note `-i`; use client-credentials or legacy auth):

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e CREATIO_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
  -e CREATIO_BASE_URL="https://your-creatio.com" \
  -e CREATIO_LOGIN="YourLogin" -e CREATIO_PASSWORD="YourPassword" \
  crackish/mcp-creatio
```

# Changelog

All notable changes to **mcp-creatio** are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-24

File text extraction for `read-file`, plus broker OAuth support for web clients. Version bumped
from 0.6.7 so the running build is identifiable via `serverInfo.version` (the whole 0.6.x series
reported 0.6.7, making deployed builds indistinguishable). Live-verified against a real Creatio
instance over OAuth: per-user permissions enforced, document text extraction (docx/xlsx/pdf+OCR/
edoc/rtf/doc/msg) working end-to-end.

### Added

- **`CREATIO_MCP_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_ORIGINS` — broker OAuth for web clients** — dynamic client
  registration previously accepted only loopback / app-scheme redirect URIs (native apps), so a
  web client like Open WebUI failed with "Registration failed" (its callback is its own https
  origin). Deployments can now allowlist specific https origins (comma-separated, compared by
  origin, https-only); loopback and app schemes remain always allowed, everything else stays
  rejected.

- **`read-file` server-side TEXT extraction (new default)** — `format:"text"` extracts readable
  content on the server instead of returning base64: `.docx` (paragraphs/tables/footnotes, Word
  field plumbing stripped), `.xlsx` → CSV per sheet, `.pdf` text layer with **automatic OCR for
  scanned PDFs** (tesseract.js + pdf.js rendering; `lav+eng+rus` default, first 10 pages,
  `CREATIO_MCP_OCR_*` env knobs, Docker image bundles offline traineddata), `.edoc`/`.asice`
  ASiC-E signed containers (payload unwrapped, nested containers recursed, images listed as
  skipped), `.rtf` (real tokenizer with `\u`/`\'hh` escapes and the cp1257 Baltic codepage),
  legacy `.doc` (`word-extractor`), Outlook `.msg` (`@kenjiuno/msgreader`), and plain text.
  Rationale: base64 of a typical `.docx` tokenizes ~17x larger than its text and is undecodable
  by chat-only MCP clients. Extracted text is capped by `maxChars` (default 150,000;
  `extraction.truncated` flag), formats with no text path fail with
  `creatio_file_text_unsupported` pointing at `format:"base64"`, and the containers are parsed by
  a dependency-free ZIP reader (`zlib` only). `format:"base64"` keeps the previous behavior
  byte-for-byte.

- **`read-file` tool — download file attachment content** — a new read-only core tool that fetches
  the binary content of Creatio file attachments (`ActivityFile`, `AccountFile`, custom
  `<Section>File` entities) via the OData file API (`GET /0/odata/<Entity>(<id>)/Data`) and returns
  it base64-encoded with `fileName` / `contentType` / `sizeBytes` metadata. Guarded by a `maxBytes`
  limit (default 10 MB = 10,000,000 bytes; hard cap 50 MB = 50,000,000, clamped in the provider so
  direct engine callers get the ceiling too; refused with `creatio_file_too_large` — up front via
  `Content-Length` when declared, else the streaming read aborts the moment the limit is crossed).
  Registered in readonly mode, and delivered through a new `FileProvider` contract +
  `FileServiceProvider` + `FileEngine` following the one-contract/one-provider/one-engine-per-domain
  pattern. Binary-safety details: bodies are streamed as bytes (never coerced to text); the tool
  result deliberately bypasses the output secret-scrubber (a multi-megabyte base64 stream can match
  the scrubber's value patterns by chance, which would silently corrupt the file); auth headers are
  rebuilt inside the retry factory so the one-shot re-auth retry sends the refreshed credential; and
  an exhausted login bounce (followed redirect to HTML) is rejected with
  `creatio_download_file_failed:auth_bounce` instead of being returned as the file's bytes.

## [0.6.7]

Credential flexibility and multi-tenant hardening: `gateway`/`delegated` now accept a forwarded
Creatio session cookie (not just a Bearer), and the schema caches are shared, per-tenant, bounded,
and stampede-safe. 608 tests; live-verified on two Creatio instances (both CRUD backends, cookie
passthrough, and dynamic-tool discovery).

### Added

- **Cookie / multi-shape credential passthrough (`delegated` & `gateway`)** — a client or Control-Plane
  that holds a Creatio Forms-auth session (cookie + `BPMCSRF`) instead of an OAuth Bearer can now
  connect by forwarding it in `X-Creatio-Cookie` (BPMCSRF read from the cookie, or an explicit
  `X-Creatio-Bpmcsrf` header). The per-request credential is a typed `InjectedCredential`
  (`bearer | cookie`); the stateless passthrough provider attaches `Authorization: Bearer` or
  `Cookie` + `BPMCSRF` + `ForceUseSession` — no cookie jar, no per-credential pool. `Authorization`
  takes precedence when both are present.

### Changed

- **Shared `VersionedTtlCache` for schema caches** — OData `$metadata` / entity-sets and DataService
  runtime schemas now use one version + TTL + LRU cache, keyed per base URL. Fixes a multi-tenant
  `$metadata` re-fetch thrash on every interleaved tenant switch (the OData store was single-slot) and
  bounds the previously unbounded DataService schema cache.
- **Single-flight schema loads + deduped `legacy` login** — concurrent cache misses for the same
  schema coalesce into one fetch; concurrent `legacy` re-logins coalesce into one `AuthService` call
  (matching the OAuth2 and broker providers).

## [0.6.6]

Kubernetes readiness: dedicated liveness/readiness HTTP probes and a hardened container image, so the
HTTP server can be orchestrated with standard health checks. 586 tests.

### Added

- **Liveness/readiness endpoints** — `GET /healthz` (liveness) and `GET /readyz` (readiness) on the
  HTTP server, registered ahead of the auth and request-logging middleware so probes are
  unauthenticated and stay out of the request log. `/healthz` reports the process is up (name,
  version, uptime); `/readyz` returns `200` once the listener is accepting connections and flips to
  `503` at the start of graceful shutdown, so an orchestrator drains the instance before its
  connections are torn down.

### Changed

- **Dockerfile hardened for orchestration** — the runtime image now runs as the unprivileged `node`
  user and declares a container `HEALTHCHECK` against `/healthz`.

## [0.6.5]

Per-tenant tool isolation for multi-tenant (`gateway`) deployments, plus a reusable live-regression
harness. Live-verified across all five auth modes against two real Creatio instances; 583 tests,
94.7% line coverage.

### Added

- **Per-tenant dynamic-tool isolation (`gateway` mode)** — a single MCP deployment serving many
  Creatio instances now keeps each tenant's tool surface separate, keyed by the effective base URL
  (`X-Creatio-Base-Url`, else `CREATIO_BASE_URL`). Optional capabilities are **probed per tenant** and
  the tools they expose — DataForge, Global Search, and the dynamically discovered per-instance
  published tools — register only for the tenant they were found on. A new `TenantToolRegistry`
  (`src/server/mcp/tenant-tool-registry.ts`) holds the per-tenant capability verdicts, dynamic tools,
  and live session servers, with idle-TTL + LRU eviction that never drops a tenant with a live
  session. Single-tenant modes (everything except `gateway` with an override) map to one bucket, so
  their behavior is unchanged.
- **Reusable live-regression harness** (`scripts/live-regression.mjs`) — config-driven end-to-end
  smoke against a real Creatio over MCP: drives stdio + every HTTP auth mode (incl. broker DCR + PKCE
  with a local callback catcher), asserts the per-instance tool surface, and runs an opt-in full CRUD
  lifecycle (create → read-back → update → delete → verify-gone). Local credentials live in a
  gitignored `scripts/live-regression.local.json`; `*.example.json` is the committed schema. Not part
  of `npm test`.

### Fixed

- **Cross-tenant capability bleed** — previously the optional-capability probe (DataForge / Global
  Search / published tools) ran once per process from the first caller and applied that verdict to
  every tenant, so on a heterogeneous `gateway` deployment one instance's tools or `describe-entity`
  routing could surface for another. The probe and tool registration are now per-tenant.

### Changed

- `Server.createSessionServer` / `ensureCapabilitiesProbed` take the request's base-URL override and
  bind the session + probe to that tenant; `_describeEntity` resolves DataForge readiness per tenant.

## [0.6.4]

Output-edge secret redaction + a content-validated schema cache that auto-invalidates when the
Creatio data model changes (and is multi-tenant-safe). Schema-freshness live-verified vs a real
Creatio; 570 tests, 94.6% line coverage.

### Security

- **Central secret redaction** — a single `redactSecrets` layer scrubs credential-looking values
  (`Bearer`/`Basic`/`Authorization`, and `client_secret`/`password`/`access_token`/`refresh_token`/
  `BPMCSRF`-style params) from **both** tool results relayed to the client **and** log lines. This
  turns the long-standing "never leak secrets/tokens" invariant from a convention into an enforced
  choke point. Errors thrown from tool handlers are scrubbed too, while preserving the `Error`
  type/stack (no silent swallowing).

### Added

- **Content-validated schema cache** — schema/metadata caches (`describe-entity`, `list-entities`,
  DataService write-coercion, OData `$metadata`) now validate against Creatio's own client-cache
  hash stamp (`GET /api/ClientCache/Hashes` — the `runtime-entity-schema` bucket + `cacheVersion`,
  the same signal the Freedom UI uses). When the data model changes at runtime (add/alter/remove an
  entity or column) the cache self-heals within ~60s instead of serving a stale schema for up to 30
  minutes — fixing silently-wrong writes after a configuration change. Degrades gracefully to a
  coarse time-bucketed refresh when the endpoint is unavailable.
- **Per-tenant schema-cache isolation** — schema/metadata caches are keyed by Creatio base URL, so a
  `gateway`-mode deployment serving multiple instances (via `X-Creatio-Base-Url`) never serves one
  tenant's schema or metadata to another.

### Changed

- **Keep-alive reuse** — the single-session keep-alive tick (`legacy`/`client_credentials`) now also
  refreshes the schema-freshness snapshot, so its periodic ping doubles as a cache-freshness check
  rather than a bare round-trip.

### Docs

- README: concrete `delegated` / `gateway` setup examples showing what to inject and where (the
  `Authorization: Bearer …` header, plus `X-Creatio-Base-Url` for multi-tenant routing), and that
  the gateway injects a Bearer token only.

### Tests

- **570 tests, 94.6% line coverage.** New suites: secret redaction (+ error scrubbing at the tool
  boundary and the log line), ClientCache hash client, schema-freshness gate (TTL, per-base-url
  keying, degraded fallback), schema-freshness integration across both CRUD backends, and the
  keep-alive warm passthrough. The schema-freshness path was live-verified against a real Creatio.

## [0.6.3]

Security/perf/architecture remediation (from a full re-review) plus broker production-readiness.
Live-regressed across all transports vs a real Creatio; 537 tests, 94.5% line coverage.

### Security

- **Broker access tokens are audience-bound** — `aud` (the `/mcp` resource) + `iss` (origin) are
  set and verified on every `/mcp` call, so a token minted by one deployment is rejected by another
  sharing `CREATIO_MCP_JWT_SECRET` (token redirection / confused-deputy). `client_id` is bound and
  enforced on refresh.
- **`refresh_token` grant** (rotating, single-use, client-bound, gated on the broker still holding
  the user's Creatio tokens) — replaces a previously non-redeemable refresh token; standalone
  clients no longer re-consent hourly.
- **`CREATIO_MCP_JWT_SECRET` hardening** — minimum 32 chars enforced; **required in production**
  (fail-closed); ephemeral-with-warning only outside production.
- **SSRF guard** for the gateway `X-Creatio-Base-Url` override — `CREATIO_MCP_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS`
  allowlist; cloud-metadata link-local addresses always blocked.
- **OData identifier-injection guard**, **log redaction** of `code`/`state`/`token` query params,
  and **bounded DCR client store** (TTL + cap).
- **RFC 7009 `POST /revoke`** (logout) — revokes the Creatio token upstream
  (`/connect/revocation`, best-effort) and purges server-side + issued-refresh tokens; always `200`.

### Added

- **`broker` auth mode** — the MCP acts as its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server for clients (DCR +
  `/authorize` + `/token`) and brokers the user login to Creatio via authorization_code + PKCE,
  holding the user's Creatio tokens server-side. The "connect → authorize → work as me" UX for
  standalone direct clients (Claude Desktop / ChatGPT). Selected via `CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE=broker`.
- **Pluggable broker token store** — `CREATIO_MCP_TOKEN_STORE=memory` (default) | `redis`. The
  Redis store (`CREATIO_MCP_REDIS_URL`) encrypts tokens at rest (AES-256-GCM;
  `CREATIO_MCP_TOKEN_ENC_KEY` or derived from the JWT secret) with native TTL → stateless,
  restart-durable, horizontally-scalable broker.
- **`CREATIO_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`** — pins issuer/audience/redirects/discovery to the external origin
  behind a TLS-terminating proxy.
- **Proactive session keep-alive** (`CREATIO_MCP_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS`, default `300`s, `0` disables)
  for `legacy`/`client_credentials`; reactive reconnect now also recovers from a login-page bounce,
  not only `401`.

### Changed

- **Unified env scheme** — two prefixes, `CREATIO_*` (reach + auth Creatio) and `CREATIO_MCP_*`
  (MCP behavior), with a single declarative back-compat alias table (legacy names still work with a
  one-time deprecation notice). Single `CREATIO_MCP_AUTH_MODE` selector (explicit or inferred:
  legacy → client_credentials → delegated).
- **Per-session `McpServer`** — each transport/session gets its own `McpServer` (a shared singleton
  rejected a second concurrent session's `connect()` with "Already connected to a transport").
- **Performance** — tuned global undici keep-alive dispatcher for outbound Creatio calls;
  single-flight token refresh (no thundering herd); O(1) `describe-entity` via metadata indexes;
  compact (non-pretty) tool output; capability-probe negative-cache.
- **Architecture/DRY** — `createAuthEdge` factory (auth-strategy out of `HttpServer`);
  `httpServer.ts` → `http-server.ts`; shared identifier/probe/expiry helpers; OData read +
  `getCurrentUserInfo` onto the shared `request()` helper; mutation audit now records outcome.
- **Lint** — `@typescript-eslint/member-ordering` rule codifies the class-member convention.

### Tests

- Coverage raised to **94.5% lines** (537 tests). Added the broker full-stack API suite
  (supertest) and an opt-in real-Redis integration test (auto-skips without Redis).

### CI

- Auto-create a **GitHub Release** from the CHANGELOG section on a `v*` tag push (+ a manual
  backfill path), alongside the existing Docker multi-arch publish.

## [0.6.2]

### Added

- **Docker stdio transport** — `MCP_TRANSPORT` env (`http` default | `stdio`) selects the run
  mode in the container (stdio via `docker run -i`); both transports read the same env.

### Fixed

- Declare **`express`** and **`zod`** as direct `dependencies` (previously resolved only
  transitively through the MCP SDK) — required for a correct `--omit=dev` runtime image.

### Changed

- **Docker image** rebuilt as a multi-stage build on **`node:24-alpine`**, running the compiled
  `dist/` (no `ts-node`/devDeps at runtime) via `docker-entrypoint.sh`.
- CI: GitHub Actions bumped to their Node24 majors (clears the Node20 deprecation); the
  publish workflow syncs the README to the Docker Hub repository overview.

### Docs

- AGENTS.md: run modes & deployment, DataService wire-value gotchas (verified vs core/devkit),
  engineering-principles section. README: Docker HTTP/stdio examples + `MCP_TRANSPORT`/`PORT`.

## [0.6.1]

### Added

- **Capability kill-switches** — `DISABLE_DATAFORGE` and `DISABLE_GLOBAL_SEARCH` env flags.
  When set, the capability is neither probed at startup (no network / no token spend) nor
  registered as a tool, even on an environment where it is available. `describe-entity` then
  falls back to the active CRUD backend instead of DataForge.

### Docs

- AGENTS.md: mandatory release checklist (bump → changelog → build/test → commit → tag →
  push → npm publish), engineering-principles section (SOLID / GRASP / Clean Code / patterns),
  tests-are-part-of-done rule, and the new disable flags. README env table updated.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- **Selectable CRUD backend** — OData or **DataService** (Creatio's native data API, now the
  default), chosen per-deployment via `CREATIO_CRUD_BACKEND`. Full DataService provider:
  read/create/update/delete, schema discovery via `RuntimeEntitySchemaRequest`, entity listing
  via `VwSysSchemaInWorkspace`, and metadata-driven value coercion.
- **Neutral query contract** (`ReadQuery` / `FilterNode` AST / `ReadResult`) with a per-backend
  translator (Strategy): the MCP layer is dialect-agnostic; each backend owns its translation.
- **Capability-driven read params** — the OData-only `filter` (raw `$filter`) and `expand`
  parameters are registered only when the active backend supports them.

### Fixed

- 10 issues found via live regression across both backends, incl.: OData ISO date/datetime
  literals now emitted unquoted (`Edm.Date`/`Edm.DateTimeOffset`); `describe-entity` `source`
  reflects the active backend; DataService `FilterComparisonType` wire values corrected
  (gt/ge/lt/le/contains/endswith); `list-entities` de-duplication; lookup-FK select/path
  normalization; primary-column (`Photo`) projection; count/`top:0` handling; extended→base
  `DataValueType` coercion; lookup-FK write mapping; quoted profile-tz DateTime parameters; and
  the explicit `IsNull` flag (fixes inverted `isNotNull`).

### Changed

- `services/` restructured into symmetric `odata/` and `dataservice/` folders; shared
  `assertEntityName` / `lookupIdPath` helpers; `odataRoot` moved into the OData layer so the
  shared HTTP client stays transport-only.

## [0.5.1]

### Changed

- Architecture audit refactor: `ICreatioAuthProvider` split by capability (ISP/LSP) into
  core + `IRevocable` + `IInteractive`; directory rename `providers → contracts`,
  `services → sessions`; `server.ts` God-method slimmed into a declarative tool table;
  centralized `CreatioHttpClient.request()` helper; idle-TTL eviction of session user tokens.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **DataForge** env-gated MCP tools (semantic data-model layer) + `describe-entity` routing.
- **Global Search** tool, plus hardened structured read lookup filters.
- **Read pagination** (`$skip`) and **total count** (`$count`) with a default page size.
- **Published-tools proxy** — surfaces tools published in the in-Creatio CrtMCPPublishingApp
  (hidden, env-gated via `ENABLE_PUBLISHED_TOOLS`).
- CRUD backend selection seam + DataService groundwork.
- Engine layer earns its place: cross-cutting readonly guard + audit trail.

## [0.4.1]

### Changed

- Publish only `dist/` to npm (added `files` whitelist).
- Dependency bumps (TypeScript, `@types/node`, `fast-xml-parser`).
- Testing made mandatory; coverage raised to 90%+ across statements/functions/lines.

## [0.3.0]

- Baseline: Creatio MCP server (CRUD, schema inspection, process execution, sys settings,
  admin operations) over OData, with stdio + HTTP run modes and legacy/OAuth2 authentication.
